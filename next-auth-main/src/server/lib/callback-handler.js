// This function handles the complex flow of signing users in, and either creating,
// linking (or not linking) accounts depending on if the user is currently logged
// in, if they have account already and the authentication mechanism they are using.
//
// It prevents insecure behaviour, such as linking oAuth accounts unless a user is
// signed in and authenticated with an existing valid account.
//
// All verification (e.g. oAuth flows or email address verificaiton flows) are
// done prior to this handler being called to avoid additonal complexity in this
// handler.
